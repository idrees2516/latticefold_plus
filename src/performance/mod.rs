/// Performance Benchmarking and Analysis Module
/// 
/// This module provides comprehensive performance benchmarking, analysis,
/// and monitoring capabilities for the LatticeFold+ proof system as
/// specified in task 15.2. It includes:
/// 
/// - Comprehensive performance benchmarking framework
/// - Comparison benchmarks against LatticeFold and HyperNova
/// - Performance regression testing with automated alerts
/// - Scalability testing with large parameter sets
/// - Memory usage profiling and optimization validation
/// - Performance analysis documentation with bottleneck identification
/// - Performance optimization recommendations based on benchmark results
/// 
/// The module integrates with the Criterion benchmarking framework for
/// statistical analysis and provides detailed reporting capabilities
/// for performance monitoring and optimization.
